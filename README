Sets trackpoint sensitivity on thinkpads.

Call tp-trackpoint to see how it works.

To set things on startup/on configuration changes, install 
tp-trackpoint.service and tp-trackpoint.path to systemd, enable 
tp-trackpoint.path and copy tp-trackpoint.conf to /etc/default/tp-trackpoint.

A package is also built at https://launchpad.net/~shuhao/+archive/ubuntu/fixed
