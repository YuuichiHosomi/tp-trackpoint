Sets trackpoint sensitivity on thinkpads.

Call tp-trackpoint to see how it works.

To set things on startup/on configuration changes, install
tp-trackpoint.service and tp-trackpoint.path to systemd, enable
tp-trackpoint.path and copy tp-trackpoint.conf to /etc/default/tp-trackpoint.

A package is also built at https://launchpad.net/~shuhao/+archive/ubuntu/fixed


On some systems, it is possible the sys device path for the trackpoint is not
at /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2 but at somewhere like
/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio4/serio5. In these case, overwrite the
variable in the conf file and also add a systemd override for the
ConditionPathExists
